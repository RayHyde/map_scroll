        <h1>Scroll to elements on a large background</h1>

<p>This uses the scrollTo() Javascript method to move to different points on a background larger than the screen (in this case a world map), thus creating a panning effect.</p>
<p>Additional effects are added each time scrolling stops: a box with information about that stop opens automatically. Clicking the background closes each individual box.</p>

<h2>My Playground</h2>

<p>This project is part of my Playground - a collection of fun (and dare I say it: clever) stuff I made in the past, from jQuery games and plugins to CSS animation tricks.</p>
